        - I'm a psychologist and neuroscientist!
        - I completed my Ph.D. at the IDG / McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Beijing Normal University. Then I became a faculty in the Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I worked as a visiting associate in the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, from 2017 to 2019.  Now I work in CCBS at the University of Macau. 
        - "I am interested in exploring the mechanisms that describe and/or affect behavioral and neural responses during emotion and decision making (both for human and human-AI interaction) in social interaction. My interest also lies in the area of the interactions between social information processing and decision. In my research, I use diverse methods (Mturk, EEE/sEEG recordings, eye/mouse tracking, AI, neuromodulation, and fMRI) to find answers to the following questions:"
        - Computational Modeling and Quantification of Social Cognitive Processes
        - How can we develop robust computational frameworks to quantify and measure critical dimensions of social inference, decision-making, and strategic interactions?
        - Neuromodulation of Social Adaptive Mechanisms
        - What are the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying social adaptation, and how can they be selectively modulated to enhance or alter adaptive behaviors?
        - Neurocomputational Dynamics of Reward and Punishment in Human-AI Interactions
        - How do reward and punishment systems interact and compete during social decision-making, particularly in the context of human interactions with artificial agents?
        - Representational Dynamics of Social Information and Behavioral Computation
        - How does the neural and cognitive representation of social information shape behavioral structure and influence computational modes of decision-making?

      content: Haoming is a fourth-year PhD student in the lab. Before joining the A.N.D lab, Haoming received his bachelor’s degree at Southern University of Science and Technology. He is mainly interested in two specific topics. The first one is to investigate how the brain encoding the information about the direction of motion (forward & backward) by using intracranial electroencephalographic to recording and analyze the electrophysiological signal. The second is to investigate the neural machinery of the human brain for making safe, risky decisions. Haoming uses different kinds of methods in the research, which include EEG, sEEG, machine learning, and neural network.

Kun's research passions lie in two interconnected areas: 1) Investigating how different forms of knowledge are encoded and retrieved in the human brain, and understanding how these representations influence our behavior. 2) Building on this foundation, he extends his inquiry to the representation of emotions. Utilizing computational modeling and neural recording techniques, Kun explores how emotions are represented and processed in the brain, and how they shape social decisions."

      content: Xinyi is a third-year Ph.D. student in the lab. Before joining the lab, she received her bachelor’s degree in EE at Wuhan University of Technology. Her research seeks to  investigate 1)  how moral decisions shape memory, 2) the role of cognitive control brain in regulating this interaction, 3) neurocompuational mechanism of metacognition. She uses diverse methods (fMRI, sEEG, mouse tracking, computational modeling and neural networks) with aims to reveal the cognitive and neural processes behind social cognition.

      content: Keyu is a third-year Ph.D. student who received B.Sc. (Psychology) degrees from both Southwest University in Chongqing, China, and the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Generally, she is interested in investigating the neural basis of social cognition and affection using multi-modality methods in topics including 1) the intrinsically biased or limited information sampling process, together with 2) their impact on adaptive learning and decision-making and 3) the role of individuals' affective experience during those processes.
