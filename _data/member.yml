        - I'm a psychologist and neuroscientist!
        - I completed my Ph.D. at the IDG / McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Beijing Normal University. Then I became a faculty in the Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I worked as a visiting associate in the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, from 2017 to 2019.  Now I work in CCBS at the University of Macau. 
        - "I am interested in exploring the mechanisms that describe and/or affect behavioral and neural responses during emotion and decision making (both for human and human-AI interaction) in social interaction. My interest also lies in the area of the interactions between social relations cognition and languages. In my research, I use diverse methods (Mturk, psychophysiological recordings, mouse tracking, and fMRI) to find answers to below questions:"
        - " - How can we compute and measure aspects of social inference, decision making, and strategic interactions?"
        - " - What is the role of oxytocin in the social adaptation brain?"
        - " - How do reward and punishment systems interact during social decisions and interaction with AIs?"
        - " - How representation of social relations be affected by (different) language structure?"
