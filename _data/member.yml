        - I'm a psychologist and neuroscientist!
        - I completed my Ph.D. at the IDG / McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Beijing Normal University. Then I became a faculty in the Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I worked as a visiting associate in the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, from 2017 to 2019.  Now I work in CCBS at the University of Macau. 
        - "I am interested in exploring the mechanisms that describe and/or affect behavioral and neural responses during emotion and decision making (both for human and human-AI interaction) in social interaction. My interest also lies in the area of the interactions between social relations cognition and languages. In my research, I use diverse methods (Mturk, psychophysiological recordings, mouse tracking, and fMRI) to find answers to below questions:"
        - " - How can we compute and measure aspects of social inference, decision making, and strategic interactions?"
        - " - What is the role of oxytocin in the social adaptation brain?"
        - " - How do reward and punishment systems interact during social decisions and interaction with AIs?"
        - " - How representation of social relations be affected by (different) language structure?"

      content: Haoming is a fourth-year PhD student in the lab. Before joining the A.N.D lab, Haoming received his bachelor’s degree at Southern University of Science and Technology. He is mainly interested in two specific topics. The first one is to investigate how the brain encoding the information about the direction of motion (forward & backward) by using intracranial electroencephalographic to recording and analyze the electrophysiological signal. The second is to investigate the neural machinery of the human brain for making safe, risky decisions. Haoming uses different kinds of methods in the research, which include EEG, sEEG, machine learning, and neural network.

Kun's research passions lie in two interconnected areas: 1) Investigating how different forms of knowledge are encoded and retrieved in the human brain, and understanding how these representations influence our behavior. 2) Building on this foundation, he extends his inquiry to the representation of emotions. Utilizing computational modeling and neural recording techniques, Kun explores how emotions are represented and processed in the brain, and how they shape social decisions."

      content: Xinyi is a third-year Ph.D. student in the lab. Before joining the lab, she received her bachelor’s degree in EE at Wuhan University of Technology. Her research seeks to  investigate 1)  how moral decisions shape memory, 2) the role of cognitive control brain in regulating this interaction, 3) neurocompuational mechanism of metacognition. She uses diverse methods (fMRI, sEEG, mouse tracking, computational modeling and neural networks) with aims to reveal the cognitive and neural processes behind social cognition.

      content: Keyu is a third-year Ph.D. student who received B.Sc. (Psychology) degrees from both Southwest University in Chongqing, China, and the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Generally, she is interested in investigating the neural basis of social cognition and affection using multi-modality methods in topics including 1) the intrinsically biased or limited information sampling process, together with 2) their impact on adaptive learning and decision-making and 3) the role of individuals' affective experience during those processes.
