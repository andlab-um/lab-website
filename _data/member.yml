        - I'm a psychologist and neuroscientist!
        - I completed my Ph.D. at the IDG / McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Beijing Normal University. Then I became a faculty in the Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I worked as a visiting associate in the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, from 2017 to 2019.  Now I work in CCBS at the University of Macau. 
        - "I am interested in exploring the mechanisms that describe and/or affect behavioral and neural responses during emotion and decision making (both for human and human-AI interaction) in social interaction. My interest also lies in the area of the interactions between social relations cognition and languages. In my research, I use diverse methods (Mturk, psychophysiological recordings, mouse tracking, and fMRI) to find answers to below questions:"
        - " - How can we compute and measure aspects of social inference, decision making, and strategic interactions?"
        - " - What is the role of oxytocin in the social adaptation brain?"
        - " - How do reward and punishment systems interact during social decisions and interaction with AIs?"
        - " - How representation of social relations be affected by (different) language structure?"

      content: Zhaoning is a second-year PhD student in the lab. He received a B.E. degree in Information Security and an M.E. degree in Software Engineering, both from Sun Yat-Sen University. Enlightened by Heinrich Heine’s famous quote, ‘Thought precedes action, as lighting does thunder’, Zhaoning devoted himself to theoretical research after familiarizing with empirical research and application. Specifically, he aspires to make contributions to a “virtuous circle”, in which shared insights into Artificial Intelligence and social psychology will advance the development of both fields. Eventually, Zhaoning will try to build a theory in this area by working his ass off, despite how naive the theory is and what difficulties he will meet. As the founder of modern social psychology, Kurt Lewin said, there is nothing more practical than a good theory.
