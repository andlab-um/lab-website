## Research Directions

1) *Computational Modeling and Quantification of Social Cognitive Processes*:
   How can we develop robust computational frameworks to quantify and measure critical dimensions of social inference, decision-making, and strategic interactions?

2) *Neuromodulation of Social Adaptive Mechanisms*:
   What are the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying social adaptation, and how can they be selectively modulated to enhance or alter adaptive behaviors?

3) *Neurocomputational Dynamics of Reward and Punishment in Human-AI Interactions*:
   How do reward and punishment systems interact and compete during social decision-making, particularly in the context of human interactions with artificial agents?

**2025.5.10** ANDLab has preprinted a perspective article titled "AI in the computation and regulation of social decision-making."（Authors: Shuo Zhang, Leo Chi U Seak, Raymond J Dolan, and Haiyan Wu）. This article argues that  social decision research should fully leverage the potential of AI to advance task design, data analysis, and human-AI interaction research comprehensively. 
In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), social decision-making research stands at a transformative crossroads. The rise of AI has introduced innovative perspectives and methodologies, enabling researchers to address challenges in social decision-making in unprecedented ways. Leveraging AI's powerful data processing capabilities, researchers can transcend the limitations of traditional experimental paradigms and design tasks that more closely resemble real-world scenarios, exploring social decisions in more realistic contexts. By utilizing diverse AI models, researchers can analyze complex social interaction data, model social agents, or simulate social dynamics. Moreover, as AI becomes increasingly embedded in people's daily lives, it is imperative to incorporate AI as an interactive agent, systematically examining its impact on humans and the interactions between humans and these more advanced AI systems. To prepare for a society where humans and AI coexist, we advocate for establishing an online social task platform where human participants and AI agents coexist. This hybrid platform emphasizes multiple agents, the generalization from traditional tasks to naturalistic tasks, and integrative platforms with the interface of neuroimage data, providing an effective framework for exploring social cognition in the AI era. These advancements help pave the way for developing socially intelligent AI systems equipped with intuition and ethics, enabling seamless and natural interactions within complex social ecosystems. Our review aims to advance the scientific understanding of human social cognition while promoting the development of AI systems that integrate AI tools and agents into social decision-making and social neuroscience studies.

**2024.3.13** ANDLab preprinted an article titled ‘Unethical amnesia brain: Memory and metacognitive distortion induced by dishonesty’. In this article, we investigate the neural and computational mechanisms underlying the metacognition distortion caused by repeated dishonesty.
We find that: 
1) Immediate and delayed metacognition changes manifest on multiple dimensions of response in the pre-and post-scan memory tasks;
2) The compression of representational geometry of reward in OFC was correlated with both immediate and delayed metacognition changes;
3) Functional connectivity (FC) between DLPFC and lTPJ under dishonest responses predicts both immediate and delayed metacognition changes.

These results suggest that decision-making, emotion, and memory-related brain regions together play a key role in metacognition change after immoral action, shedding light on the neural mechanism of the complex interplay between moral decisions, cognitive processes, and memory distortion.

**2024.1.16** ANDLab preprinted an article titled "An intracranial dissection of human escape circuits". In this preprint, we found the brain regions in the cognitive fear circuit, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, encoded the threat level during the information processing stage. The actual escaping stage, especially under rapid attack, prominently activated areas within the reactive fear circuit, including the midcingulate cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between the high gamma activity (HGA) of the amygdala and the HGA of the vmPFC and HPC under rapid attacks. This indicates that the amygdala may suppress the activity of the cognitive fear circuit under rapid attacks, enabling the organism to react quickly to ensure survival under the imminent threat. @Macau
