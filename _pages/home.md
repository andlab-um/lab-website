## Roadmap

<!-- Our current **<span style="color:#e06666">research directions</span>**: -->
## Research Directions

1) *Social cognition and affective neuroscience*: the multi-modal representation of negative emotional experiences (anxiety, fear, helpless) and its neurocomputation; the learning and representation of social information (social distance, emotional variability, affiliation) and its influence on social relationship; the neurocomputation of mentalizing and social decision-making (dishonesty decisions); the effect of pharmaceutical modulation (oxytocin) and neuromodulation (TMS&TDCS) on social cognition and behaviors.

2) *Computational neuroscience*: we mainly leverage Bayesian modeling, Reinforcement learning, Drift-diffusion model to quantify human social learning and adaptive social decision-making.

3) *Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human-AI interaction*: e.g., how AI facilitates empathy and interaction between human-AI and even between human-human, how human perceive and inference the affect of AI.

## News
**2025.5.10** ANDLab has preprinted a perspective article titled "The Computation and Regulation of Artificial Intelligence in Social Decision-Making." In the age of artificial intelligence, social decision-making research is undergoing a profound transformation in computational paradigms. We believe that the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) not only provides abundant computational resources for social decision-making research but also opens up entirely new perspectives and approaches.
This article argues that, under this backdrop, social decision-making research should fully leverage the potential of AI to advance task design, data analysis, and human-AI interaction research comprehensively. First, the powerful computational capabilities of AI allow us to design more natural decision-making tasks, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional tasks that are often overly simplistic and abstract. These naturalistic tasks are closer to real-world scenarios, enabling researchers to delve deeply into the mechanisms underlying complex social decision-making. At the same time, the diversity of AI models provides unprecedented opportunities to analyze social decision-making from various perspectives. For instance, robust AI models can process multi-dimensional, complex social interaction data or large-scale social decision-making datasets, helping researchers overcome the computational limitations of traditional methods.
Second, AI is not just a tool for analysis but also a critical medium for modeling social intelligent agents. By modeling social cognitive processes, AI can simulate and replicate mechanisms of social decision-making. Furthermore, AI can transcend physical constraints, simulating dynamic social environments. The rapid development of large language models, in particular, enables multi-scale social simulations, ranging from interaction patterns within small groups to the evolution and development of entire societies.
Beyond task design and data analysis, the increasing prevalence of AI further underscores the importance of research into human-AI interactions. How will the deep integration of AI influence our social behaviors and decisions? Will it subtly exacerbate social biases? What forms will human-AI collaboration or competition take? These questions are not only relevant to AI technology itself but also crucial to the future trajectory of society.
In light of these considerations, we propose the establishment of an online platform for social decision-making tasks. On this platform, AI is not merely a tool but an active participant, viewed as an integral member of the social community. This platform aims to achieve the following three core objectives:
1.	Human-AI Joint Participation: Positioning AI and humans as equal decision-making agents to explore their respective mechanisms of social decision-making and patterns of human-AI interaction.
2.	Transition from Traditional to Natural Tasks: Designing more naturalistic tasks to study human-AI social decision-making mechanisms across diverse scenarios, thereby enhancing the external validity and generalizability of research findings.
3.	Openness and Diversity: Leveraging an online platform to expand the diversity of research data and improve the transparency and openness of research.
Finally, we discuss the significance of integrating this social decision-making task platform with the computational transformation of AI-based social research. This integration might be a crucial step toward realizing strong artificial social intelligence. On the data level, the platform can help AI more accurately simulate the social dynamics of the real world; on the computational level, algorithms grounded in social cognition can enable AI to better align with the authentic cognitive processes of humans. This platform holds transformative significance for social science research and provides a novel pathway for the future development of the social decision-making field.

**2024.3.13** ANDLab preprinted an article titled ‘Unethical amnesia brain: Memory and metacognitive distortion induced by dishonesty’. In this article, we investigate the neural and computational mechanisms underlying the metacognition distortion caused by repeated dishonesty.
We find that: 
1) Immediate and delayed metacognition changes manifest on multiple dimensions of response in the pre-and post-scan memory tasks;
2) The compression of representational geometry of reward in OFC was correlated with both immediate and delayed metacognition changes;
3) Functional connectivity (FC) between DLPFC and lTPJ under dishonest responses predicts both immediate and delayed metacognition changes.

These results suggest that decision-making, emotion, and memory-related brain regions together play a key role in metacognition change after immoral action, shedding light on the neural mechanism of the complex interplay between moral decisions, cognitive processes, and memory distortion.

**2024.1.16** ANDLab preprinted an article titled "An intracranial dissection of human escape circuits". In this preprint, we found the brain regions in the cognitive fear circuit, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, encoded the threat level during the information processing stage. The actual escaping stage, especially under rapid attack, prominently activated areas within the reactive fear circuit, including the midcingulate cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between the high gamma activity (HGA) of the amygdala and the HGA of the vmPFC and HPC under rapid attacks. This indicates that the amygdala may suppress the activity of the cognitive fear circuit under rapid attacks, enabling the organism to react quickly to ensure survival under the imminent threat. @Macau
