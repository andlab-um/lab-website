> *We welcome students from different backgrounds, e.g., psychology, neuroscience, biomedical engineering or a related field.*

### Postdoc Position

The Postdoc position is available for ANDlab, details can be found [here](https://rskto.um.edu.mo/umtp/#02), or contact <haiyanwu@um.edu.mo>.

### Graduate Student

We are recruiting PhD students in 2026.

### Research Assistant

The laboratory has openings for part-time volunteer research assistants. Primary responsibilities include assisting in the collection, processing, and analysis of behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging data. We require a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week for at least one quarter. Please email me (<haiyanwu@um.edu.mo>) for more information.

### Platform Engineer for Cognitive Psychology Experiment Platform

We are hiring a platform engineer to help develop an online experimental platform for cognitive psychology research. This platform will be used to run psychology tasks and simple games in synchronization with **EEG (electroencephalography)** or **fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)** systems, supporting experimental design and data acquisition in cognitive neuroscience.

#### Responsibilities

1. **Platform Development & Maintenance**  
- Design and develop the overall platform architecture, including frontend, backend, and database;  
- Implement online presentation of cognitive tasks and synchronized data collection;  
- Ensure compatibility and real-time synchronization with EEG/fMRI equipment.

2. **Integration with Large Language Models and Agent Frameworks**  
- Integrate mainstream large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) to support experimental content generation and dynamic task adaptation;  
- Build automated workflows or multi-agent systems (e.g., using n8n, LangGraph) to enable modular and visualized experimental design.

3. **Deployment & Maintenance**  
- Handle the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of the platform;  
- Collaborate with the research team to continuously improve and extend platform functionality.

#### Requirements

**Minimum Qualifications:**  
- Background in computer science or demonstrated full-stack development skills;  
- Proficiency in modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React or Vue);  
- Experience with backend development (Node.js, Python) and common databases;  
- Familiarity with cloud server deployment and containerization (e.g., Docker);  
- Good documentation and code management practices.

**Preferred Qualifications:**  
- Experience in building psychology or neuroscience experimental systems;  
- Familiarity with EEG/fMRI data acquisition and synchronization protocols;  
- Knowledge of workflow automation or multi-agent frameworks (e.g., n8n, LangGraph, AutoGen);  
- Prior collaboration in academic research teams and ability to understand experimental requirements.

#### Work Arrangement & Compensation

- **Location**: Remote work preferred, with possible short-term on-site collaboration depending on project needs;  
- **Collaboration Model**: Flexible, including project-based, part-time, or long-term cooperation;  
- **Compensation**: Based on project tasks or development phases, negotiable.

#### How to Apply

Please send the following materials to **um.andlab@gmail.com** (email subject: *Platform Engineer Application + Your Name*):

- CV / Resume;  
- Links to relevant projects or portfolios (e.g., GitHub);  
- Brief self-introduction and availability.
